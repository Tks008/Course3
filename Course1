Course: AI&ML June 2023

For me my course 1 was EDA (exploratory data analysis) and I like everything in that course.
It was challenging due to not having expertise on Python but it was fun learning it. Due to my experience I am familiar with EDA.

So for my learning experience has been fantastic. Enjoying the platform and I must say upGrade course is very thorough and I am liking that I must be completing everything. At times it very challenging but I am sure the outcome will be rewarding.
