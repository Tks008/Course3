Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Aishwarya K Shetty
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and conquer technique involves recursively breaking the problem into sub problems untill they can be solved diretly
Finally we combine the solution of sub-problems to get the solution to the original problem
Example:Merge sort
