2)Divide and Conquer Algorithms
3)Dynamic Programming


Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Hema Iyer
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
    1) It is a technique to solve algorithms by breaking them into smaller sub-problems of the same type
    2) The sub-problems are recursively solved and the solution are then combined to solve the problem
    3) Example - Binary search algorithm - This divides the search list into half with each iteration by trying to locate the element required in the middle position in a sorted list
