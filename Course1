Ashish Kumar Sharma
Exploratory Data Analysis
I found univariate analysis as very interesting where I learned that how a single column can be used to derive multiple useful information.
I learned how scatter plots can be drawn to show a trend. Finding Correlation was an another interesting thing I learned in Bivariate analysis.  
Drawing histogram plots using python programming was an awesome thing to learn.
