Divide and Conquer Algorithms - 
1. This technique can be divided into 3 parts: 
	Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
	Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
	Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.
2. A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. 
3. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem
4. With this approach the difficult problem can be solved easily.
5. Reduces time complexity of the problem
