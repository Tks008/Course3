Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Har Shobhit Dayal
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis deals with analyzing the space and time complexity taken by an algorithm.
Worst case scenario is mostly taken in calculation of  time complexity of an algorithms.
Algorithm analysis can help in choosing the algorithms which are more efficient than others.
