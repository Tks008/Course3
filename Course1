Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Divya Sodha
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
A divide and conquer algorithm is a strategy of solving a large problem by
   1) Divide - breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
   2) Conquer - solving the sub-problems, and
   3) Combine - combining them to get the desired output.
Its applications are for example Binary search, Quick Sort and Merge Sort algorithms.
