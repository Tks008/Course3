Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Anmol Vijaywargiya
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and Conquer algorithms are problem-solving techniques that break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
These subproblems are solved recursively, often independently, and their solutions are combined to solve the original problem.
