Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating the performance of an algorithm, usually in terms of its time and space complexity. There are several ways to analyze the performance of an algorithm, including asymptotic analysis, which analyzes the behavior of an algorithm as the size of the input grows indefinitely.
