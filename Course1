Data Visualisation in Python
During my learning, I felt that data visualization in Python is a powerful tool for exploring and communicating insights from data. Python provides various libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, that offer a wide range of customizable visualizations. I discovered that effective visualizations require careful selection of appropriate chart types, color schemes, and labeling techniques to enhance clarity and convey information accurately. Additionally, I learned the importance of storytelling through data visualization, as it helps to engage and persuade the audience effectively.
