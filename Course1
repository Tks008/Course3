Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Name : Aafreen Khan
Module : Algorithm Analysis:
1. Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating the efficiency and performance of algorithms in terms of their time complexity (how long they take to run) and space complexity (how much memory they use). 
2. It involves studying how an algorithm's execution time and memory usage increase as the size of the input data grows.
