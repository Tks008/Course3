Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Aishah Jhumka
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
It is meant to solve very complex problems.The latter is divided into subproblems and each problem chunks are solved recursively. 
Each solution is then combined to get the desired output. This approach is suitable for multiprocessing system.
