Data Visualization in Python
Here I learned about data visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
Using these libraries I learned to plot various graphs like bar, histogram, scatter plots, box plot, Heatmaps etc. These different plots help to visualize and analyze the data set in an efficient way and helps us in deriving many insights.
