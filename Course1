Python

- High level interpreted language.
- about 20 to 100 times slower than C/C++ code, therefore data analysis libraries like Numpy and Pandas are written in C. 
- One of the greatest features of python is its ability to invoke code written in other languages.
- Comprehensions have made map, reduce and filter functions mostly outdates. Reduce function is so hated by Python's founder that its removed as a core python feature now.
- While the inbuilt data structures of Python are very powerful, to be able to use real C type arrays, one has to use extended libraries.
