Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Akik Ranade
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithms efficiency is described in terms of Time and Space wherein the time efficiency calculated using CPU utilization & the Space efficiency is calculated using memory and disk usage of an algorithm. As a developer we should know the difference between Performance & complexity. Complexity analysis doesn't depend on any computer resource & may change based on the input size, since, the algorithm's performance is machine independent and does not depend on any other factors as well.
