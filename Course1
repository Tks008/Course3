Data visualization 

We learnt a great deal of presenting our data in form of grpahs and chart. The process of cleaning data by imputing(through mode, mean, avg etc), dropping data should always be practiced. The Case Study presented the ways to correct and clean data. 
Hoping to see more in the Seaborn module
