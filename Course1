Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and conquer Algorithms helps to solve any problem by breaking
it into smaller sub problems (divide), then finding solutions for
these sub problems in the form of functions. After that using these 
functions again and again to solve sub problems (conquer).Finally
combining the output/results from these sub solutions to find final
solution/result.
