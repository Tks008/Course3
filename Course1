Module Favorite: Data Structures and Algorithms II

I learn about how different sorting and searching algorithms works, what their time complexity are and how to apply them into different scenarios. I also learned about recursion, which is a bit confusing too me till this day, however I learn new things and am able to apply it when needed in the future.
