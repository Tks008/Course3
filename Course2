Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Manish Konduri
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
By doing Divide and Conquer Algorithms, I had developed an habit of dividing a problem into Sub Problems. By doing this we can conquer the Sub Problems and gradually conquer the overall problem. Atlast combine the solutions of subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
