Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Name: Piyush Sukhija
Module: Exploratory Data Analysis
Learnings: We learned the initial steps in the process of machine learning which are fundamental for a good model aka EDA which help us in cleaning, refining and improve data which will be used to train the model in future studies. The EDA allows us to understand the columns adn thier relationship which in the end defines the output of the module and allows us to refine or extract relevant informtion from columns.
