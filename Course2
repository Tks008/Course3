Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is one of the techniques available to solve self-learning problems. 
It is widely used in areas such as operations research, economics and automatic control systems, among others. 
Artificial intelligence is the core application of DP since it mostly deals with learning information from a highly uncertain environment.
