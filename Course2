Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Jamshed Ahsan
Topic: Divide and Conquer Algorithms
My Learnings:
1. How to divide any big problem (say 'base' problem) into smaller problem in order to reduce complexity/challenge 
2. Make solution for each smaller problem until all the sub-problems are solved
3. How to integrate/evolve final solution to 'base' problem
