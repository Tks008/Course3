Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Pearl Dsilva
Dynamic Programming
Got an understanding that when problems have the properties of Optimal Substructure and Overlapping subproblems, Dynamic programming would be a better way to approach the problem as compared to greedy algorithms. Also, Dynamic programming has better runtime efficiency than recursion.
