1) Algorithm Analysis :
Algorithm is a set of procedure for a problem to get an accurate and proper formatted result on time.
we are also having some set of built in functions and some set of standard procedures or algorithms. 
Sometimes we have to follow our own algorithms when the procedure preformance is better. 

2) Divide and Conquer Algorithms : 
It is an another name of merge sort. We are dividing the data structure to one element structure and 
based on the requirement the divided element will be merged and formed a single data structure again.

3) Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring 
it into sub problems.
