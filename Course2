Inheritance
  -> Inheritanec can let you extend the behaviour of once class by inherting the properties of other class.
  -> Class which contains the commooooooon properties is called superclass
  -> Class whihc inherits the properties is called subclass

  -> Static Polymorphism. It happens at compile time. Method overloading is an example of that
  -> Synamic Polymorphism. It happens at runtime. Method overriding fits here.
