What I learnt from it?
- Exploratory Data Analysis is the first step that we do in order to find patterns, trends and relationships
- After all these patterns are found, we will be making business decisions based on the information gained
- The the first and one of the important steps involved is Data Sourcing.
	- We must ensure that we are getting data from different possible and verified sources.
	- If we don't end up getting any verified data, then we remove the columns that have a lot of empty values as they will not contribute to the analysis.
	- It is not recommended to remove rows unless many of the column values in the rows are null or empty values
- Data Visualization is an excellent strategy to check for patterns in data.
- During EDA, Domain Knowledge will be extremely vital in checking for patterns as they can help in making explanations for the said patterns.
- We first start off with finding the simplest of insights using univariate analysis and then gradually start with Bivariate Analysis.
- When imputing the values of non-dropped columns, it is recommended to use the median as outliers can skew the mean. 
	- The median can usually represent most of the dataset for a particular attribute
