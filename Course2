Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Narendra Singh Shekhawat
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
You should think of a divide-and-conquer algorithm as having three parts: Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If they are small enough, solve the subproblems as base cases.
