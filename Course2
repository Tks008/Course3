Divide and Conquer Alogorithms
A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps.
1. Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
2. Conquer: Recursively solve these subproblems
3.Combine: Appropriately combine the answers
Divide and Conquer should be used when same subproblems are not evaluated many times.For example, Binary Search is a Divide and Conquer algorithm, we never evaluate the same subproblems again!
