Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Kiran
Dynamic Programming
Efficiently solve a class of problems that have overlapping subproblems. If any problem can be divided into subproblems, which in turn are divided into smaller subproblems, and if there are overlapping among these subproblems, then the solutions to these subproblems can be saved for future reference.
In this way, efficiency of the CPU can be enhanced.
