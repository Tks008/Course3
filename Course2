Name: Karan Chauhan
Module: Introduction to Git and GitHub
In this module I have learnt about the difference between git or github. I learnt how to commit, clone, push our local branch at remote.
also I found 1 thing very intresting that is how to go back to previous commit with the help of "git revert HEAD" command.
