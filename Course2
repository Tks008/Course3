Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Nancy Makasare
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and Conquer Algorithms focus on breaking down the complex problem into several smaller problems so as to ease the coplexity and achieve the purpose.
This helps make the code less lengthy thus making it easier to debug. It also makes the code less prone to errors thus delivering a more stable code.
