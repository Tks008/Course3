Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Shubham Rai
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
A divide-and-conquer algorithm is a recursive programming technique that breaks down a problem into smaller sub-problems. The sub-problems are solved independently, and then their solutions are combined to solve the original problem.
