Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Mohammed Azhar Khan
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This concept gave an idea about how we can simplify the problem by fragmenting them into smaller groups
and resolve by ultimately finding the overall solution.
This actually reduces the time in execution as it decreases the complexity.
