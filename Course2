Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Name: Pratiksha Mondal
Module: Algorithm Analysis
Details: There maybe many algorithms that solve a problem but the ones using minimum number of operations and memory are more efficient.
Number of operations determines the time taken to run the algorithm which maybe different for various inputs.
