Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Pankit Bhat
Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating and understanding the efficiency and performance characteristics of algorithms. It involves studying how an algorithm behaves in terms of time complexity and space complexity as a function of the input size. There are two types of algorithm analysis - time based and space based .
