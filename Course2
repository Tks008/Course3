Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Larry Chuon: I learned about Dynamic Programming and how to break down problems into simple concepts.  Then, use that concept to solve the subproblems.  That concept can be in pseudo-code or flowchart.  It helps simplify problems in byte size format. I recursively go through until the test condition is no long true.
