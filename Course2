1. Forking is a process where  we can create a fork of another user's branch, update the changes, create a pull request for them to review and accept/reject the changes before mergeing. Forking happens on remote repository. To update in local we would need to create a clone of the forked branch.
2. Cloning is creating a local repository for a remote repository. Local repository changes are made in local and are not reflected in remote branches untill they are pushed to remote branch.
3. We can create different branches and work concurrently. and merge these changes later on to the master branch.
