Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Prason Ghimire
Algorithm Analysis
Got to know about  measuring the effeciency of the algorithm. Learned about measuring the time and space complexity of the algorithm. Different notation like bigO, omega and theta to inicate the compexity measure also known as the asymptotic notations.
