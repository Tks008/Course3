Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Nishant Mundhra
Dynamic Programming
In the Dynamic Programming module, I learned a powerful approach to solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By storing the results of these subproblems, I avoided redundant calculations, significantly reducing time complexity.
