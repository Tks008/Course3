Exploratory Data Analysis
I have learned various interesting features for analysing data. Right from steps of Data Sourcing to Data Cleansing, i enjoyed learning univariate,bivariate,segmented and derived metrics.
I learnt from Khan Academy basics of statistics which helped me to solve questions/problems in the session. While working on various types of datasets provided in the form of excel/csv files i learnt 
pivot table creation in excel too. From various exmples that have been quoted by S Anand who shared what queries were coming from various requirements from market 
and what was approach to solve them,in the end learnt the concept of respecting my own as well as others time and hence any analysis done should be business driven and hence we should pull domain experts while starting analysis on data.
