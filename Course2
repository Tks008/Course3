Introduction to Git and GitHub
Till now i have learned about version control systems and types of version control systems
	Git is distributed version control system (DVCS), it allow you to create a local copy of the complete repository so that you can create branches and make changes locally and commit & push. We can create a pull request and merge to main branch in the central repository.
	GitHub is the web based file hosting service, allows you to host git repositories. We can contribute to lot of opensource project that are hosted on GitHub.
