Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Kifah Muqalled
Divide and Conquer Algorithms:
1)Divide and conquer algorithms involve breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems.
2)These subproblems are solved independently, and their solutions are combined to solve the original problem.
3)Key concepts include recursion, where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the problem.
4)Other important concepts include identifying base cases, defining the problem in terms of its subproblems, and combining the subproblem solutions.
