Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Pritam Pawar
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
I learned about the divide and conquer paradigm in algorithms, which involves breaking down problems into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and then combining the solutions. This approach is commonly used in algorithms like merge sort, quicksort, and binary search. Understanding this strategy has improved my problem-solving skills and efficiency in designing efficient algorithms.
