Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Manoj Bisht
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Braching concepts will help many developers work on same project without any intruption on diffrent sub parts,
also reduce the risk of false code in master branch, it will save time when project divided into sub projects and 
then many developers works parallely on same projects with diffrent sub project.
