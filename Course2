Exploratory data analysis
Averages can hide the full picture of data. Often times data will have a skewed distribution but looking at a box plot can help you identify the right next steps. When looking for patterns in data, its often useful to combine two metrics to create one business metric that can help you see the data in a different light. One example of this is combining weight and height to build a BMI metric.
