Git branching
there are situations where you may want to parallelly develop an existing project code,
without making any changes to your initial/original branch. 
You can accomplish this goal by creating different branches based on your need 
(that is, creating a branch per team member or a branch for every new feature) 
and each branch will have the same copy of the initial/original branch of the project source code.
