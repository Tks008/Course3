Hi My name is Prathima Kumari B V
My favourite module is Algorithm Analysis

Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. 
Analysis of algorithm is the process of analyzing the problem-solving capability of the algorithm in terms of the time and size required.
