Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

1) Pruthvi H N
2) Algorithm Analysis
3) Algorithm Analysis is an important process where we derive in dept insight about algorithm , which will very usefull when we use this algorithm on solving our problems 
and then if we need any changes we can apply this changes on this algorithm and derive insights of our choice
