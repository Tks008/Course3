Name: Lautaro Cisterna
Course: Introduction to Git and GitHub
Takeaways: This module was very interesting since we learnt about a very powerful tool such as GitHub. We learnt how to create an own repository, or how to clone another one that it was already created. We also learn how to create branches, and how to add and modify files (codes, data, etc.) that afterwards can be pushed to the repository.
