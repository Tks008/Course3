Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Prakash
we divide the original problem into multiple sub-problems until they cannot be divided further.
Then these sub-problems are sovled with the help of recursion.
once solved, all the subproblems are merged / combined together to form the final solution of the problem.
