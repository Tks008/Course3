Kundan Kumar
Course Name : Inheritance & Polymorphism
Alhtough the entire course 2 is quite interesting but this part required a lot more attention. This helped me to learn the very basics of all the OOPs
concept related to Inheritance and Polymorphism. Also i came to learn about composition and how it is different from Inheritance.
Dynamic and static Polymorphism is well known concepts to be learnt and the course provided all the necessary content for the same.
