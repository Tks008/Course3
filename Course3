Name: Vikram N
Module: Dynamic Programming
Description: 
1) Dynamic Programming is a problem-solving technique that is used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. 
2) It is based on the idea of using previously computed solutions to solve a larger problem, rather than recomputing the solutions every time. 
3) The technique can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as optimization, resource allocation, and sequence alignment, among others.
