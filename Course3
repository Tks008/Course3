Divide and Conquer Algorithms

I have learnt about this algorithm. This technique is based on following three parts:

Divide: Firstly dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.
