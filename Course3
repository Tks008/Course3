Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Trupti Dhumal
Divide and Conqure Algorithms
It's a three step process "Divide(break) Conqure(solve) Merge(combine)" which helps to reduce the time and space complexity of a problem 
Example :- binary search - In this rather than iterating over complete list we keep devide the sorted list of items and the apply search on that subpart of list in same way. it reduces number of iterations and hence the time complexity.
