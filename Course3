Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Suman Samarthi
Exploratory Data Analysis
To start with need to fix data issues Like:
1. Data Sourcing : Data form Public or Private sector for any alalysis.
2. Data Cleaning: 
	Making the data into proper format.
	Fixing Rows: Removing invalid rows or fixing with values for other data bases,.
	Fixing Columns: Renaming Columns consistently.
	Standardising values: To make the values consistent like in Weight in Kilo instead of few in LB and few in others.
    Invalid Values: Mobile number more than 10 digits is invalid need to be corrected.
    Filter the Data: Aggregate the data say usin9g group function.De duplicate the data.
3. Univeriate Analysis:
4. BNi veriate Analysis:
5. Derived Metrics:
	Stevens Typology classifies variables into Four types:
	1. Nominal: No relation between variables like red,blue,greemn
	2. Ordinal: They follow some order but no mathematical differences.(Primary/Secondary)
	3. Interval: Variables with mathematical differences: kmph 50kmph and 100kmph
	4. Ragtio: No mathematical differences but have ratio like Multiplication/division. $100 and $50.
