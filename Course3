Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Sarva M Sumanth
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and Conquer algorithms are great to use when we have large chunk of data. we can apply the method to small subset and parallely apply the same process to whole data to arrive at solution. It is recursive way and hence more efficient.
