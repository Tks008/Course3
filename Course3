Exploratory Data Analysis - I learned from EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) about Data Sourcing, How to Clean Data before Analysis. Learned about Univariate analysis, segmented univariate, Bivariate analysis & Derived Metrics.


3) Dynamic Programming - This technique is used in computer science and mathematics by software developers, data scientists etc to solve issues by breaking them down into smaller chunks, simpler subissues and solving each subissues only once and storing solutions to subissues in order to avoid redundant computations.
