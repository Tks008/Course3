Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Ravikiran Kongati
Algorithm Analysis
Analysis of algorithm is the process of analyzing the problem-solving capability of the algorithm in terms of the time and size required (the size of memory for storage while implementation).
However, the main concern of analysis of algorithms is the required time or performance.
To solve a problem, we need to consider time.
