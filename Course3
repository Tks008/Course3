What are the key concepts you learnt from these courses
You can choose one module from the list below:-
1)Algorithm Analysis
2)Divide and Conquer Algorithms
3)Dynamic Programming


Ok, above options look related to an algorithm related course. Nonetheless, I am familiar with git and github, and open source projects, but it is always nice to go back and look at the basics.
