Preferred: Dynamic Programming
Key takeaways from this course:-
1.The primary principle of dynamic Programming is to solve a complex problem by first breaking it down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem just once, and then storing the solutions to avoid repetitive computations.
2.The complexity of dynamic programming is reduced by reducing state space.
3.It is almost an optimization over plain recursion.
