Name : Sugnanam Satya Meghana
Module : Dynamic Programming
For recursive problems, time complexity will exponentail of n for resolving this one Dynamic Programming came to existence. By using DP we can reduce time complexity if we move to that step then it stores the value, by this if we encounter same step later then no need to calculate again. We can directly from the help of n dimension array.
