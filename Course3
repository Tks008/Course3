What are the key concepts you learnt from these courses
You can choose one module from the list below:-
1)Algorithm Analysis
2)Divide and Conquer Algorithms
3)Dynamic Programming


Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Vivek Moningi
Algorithm Analysis
I would like to choose algorithm analysis because it is very integral part of any data coding activity as it is draft version of your code before starting your programming.
A good algorithm will try to optimise by considering various complexeties like space and time.
