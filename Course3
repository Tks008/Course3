Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Suraj MU
Divide and Conquer Algorithm
Any complex problem can be solved easily by breaking it down into a finite number of small problems and solving each one of these shall lead us to the main problem's solution
This approach or technique is not only applicable in Computers but also in real life
One good example of this approach is the Binary Search Algorithm
