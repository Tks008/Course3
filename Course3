Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

1. Varun Shenoy
2. Algorithm Analysis
3. To understand hoe the algorithm behaves. Analyzing different algorithms, we can determine the best one to solve the given poroblem. they must be analysed to understand the time taken the dat flow and coding standards. Types of algorithm analysis are best case worst case and average case.
