Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Rajesh Ashok Sushir
Algorithm Analysis
Understading the problem is always a tricky thing but forming an algorithm to solve that problem is major task because while designing algorithm, we need to think in every aspects. If you design good or efficient algorithm, then it can solve problem efficiently.
