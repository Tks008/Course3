Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and conquer algorithms solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable subproblems, recursively solving these subproblems, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem. This approach reduces the overall problem-solving time by efficiently breaking it down and recombining the results.
