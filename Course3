3)Dynamic Programming


Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the problem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Raghavendra Srinivasan
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Understanding the problems and how problem to be divided to sub problems.
Then how sub problems are solved and finally, merge all the sub problem's solution to get combine output.
Divide - to divide the data into sub-problem, Conquer - solving the sub-problems and lastly combine the output to be time efficient and space efficient.
