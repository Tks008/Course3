Algorithm Analysis
1.Algorithm analysis provides essential tools to evaluate and compare the efficiency of algorithms, aiding in making informed decisions about which algorithm to use for specific tasks.
2.Big O notation serves as a powerful way to describe an algorithm's time and space complexity, helping us understand how an algorithm's performance scales with input size.
3.Through algorithm analysis, we learn that the pursuit of optimization involves trade-offs, where choosing one aspect to improve (like time complexity) might lead to compromises in another (such as space complexity)
