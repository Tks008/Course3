1) name : Rakshitha BS
2) module name of choice from course3: since I haven't started course 3, I will choose EDA module from course2.
3) EDA module focused on performing analysis on the dataset. It basically consists of five steps: sourcing,data cleaning, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, derived metrics.
