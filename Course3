Logistic Regression
It's a classification model used for making prediction in cases where the output is categorical variable.
Maximum likelihood estimation is used for finding the best fit sigmoid curve (cost function).
Once the model is built, the evaluation metrics used on the model are:
- Accuracy
- Sensitivity, specificity
- ROC curve
- Precision and Recall
