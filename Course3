Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Vijay Prasad
Algorithm Analysis
1. Understanding the requirement to create an efficient and optimal algorithm to solve it efficiently.
2. The algorithm should be optimal such that it performs the computation within the time and space constraints.
3. The algorithm should be efficient in performing enough computations within a specific time.
