Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis is used to understand how one variable affects another variable while performing analysis on a particular dataset. In bivariate analysis, we are finding out the correlation between the two variables considered for analysis : whether increase in one variable leads to a decrease of the other, whether increase in one variable leads to a increase of the other or increase/decrease of one variable doesn't affect the other.
