Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Truong Nguyen Manh
Algorithm Analysis
The efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps, known as time complexity, or volume of memory, known as space complexity.
Analysis of algorithm is the process of analyzing the problem solving capability of the algorithm in terms of the time and size required (the size of memory for storage while implementation).
There 3 types of Algorithm Analysis: Best case, worst case and average case.
