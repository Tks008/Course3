Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

RENJITH METTOTH
Algorithm Analysis
Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
I learned that the Analysis of an algorithm is the process of analyzing the problem-solving capability of the algorithm in terms of the time and size (of memory) required.
However, I understood that the main concern of analysis of algorithms is the required time or performance.
The various types of analysis I did include, Worst-case, Best-case, and Average-case.
