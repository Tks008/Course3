Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Sneha Bajaj
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Recursively breaking down a problem into two or more problem statements and then solve the sub problems and the merge the pieces into global solution.
It helps in solving a complex problem with ease.It reduces time complexity of the problem.Efficient use of memory and also ensures multiprocessing.
