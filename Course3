Arrays, ArrayLists & Linked Lists
Key Differences:
  > Internal Implementation:
	> ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements. 
	> LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements.
  > Manipulation:
	> ArrayList is slow as array manipulation is slower.
	> LinkedList is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.
  > Implementation:
	> ArrayList implements only List.
	> LinkedList implements List as well as Queue. It can acts as a queue as well.
  > Access:
	> ArrayList is faster in storing and accessing data.
	> LinkedList is faster in manipulation of data.
