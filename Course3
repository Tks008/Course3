Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Name: Shamanth B C
Module name: Divide and conquer algorithms
Learnings from the module: Divide and conquer algorithm repeatedly breaks down related problems into sub-problems. It makes the problem simple enough to be solved directly. The sub-problem solutions can be combined to solve the original problem.s
