Divide and Conquer Algorithms
The Divide and Conquer Algorithms first divide the problem into smaller problems, solve sub problems recursively and then combine the sub-problems to find solution to the whole problem. There are so many Algorithm that work on Divide and Conquer principle but the most common Algorithm is the Binary Search.
