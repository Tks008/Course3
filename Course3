We are completing Course 1 per our current academic schedule.  From Course 1 I will summarize learning sfrom Data Structures and Algorithms 
- there are various ways to write neater algorithms that have lesser time complexity
- time complexity is both Memory and Time and we need to ensure that we write the most optimal code; when intelligently applied, focus on  big O keeps your programs more efficient
- don't overuse the memory by redundant variables as that puts further stress on the resources
