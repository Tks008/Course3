Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Sarvjeet Rajvansh
Algorithm Analysis
To find out how efficient an algorith is in speed of execution and memory require to execute, we do algorithm analysis.
mainly algorithm is analyze based on time and space complexity.
we always consider the worst case to take final decision about the efficiency of the algorithm.
