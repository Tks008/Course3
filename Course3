Name - Shivani M Rao
Course - 1.Algorithm Analysis
Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating the efficiency and performance characteristics of algorithms, aiming to understand their behavior and resource consumption. It involves assessing factors such as time complexity, space complexity, and scalability to determine how well an algorithm can handle input size variations and resource constraints.
