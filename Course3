Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and conquer algorithms solve problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This approach involves three steps: dividing the problem into subproblems, conquering the subproblems through recursion or iteration, and combining the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem.
