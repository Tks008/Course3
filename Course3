Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Sachin Kumar Kesharwani
Algorithm Analysis
1. Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory.
2. To predict the behavior of an algorithm without implementing it on a specific computer.
3. It is much more convenient to have simple measures for the efficiency of an algorithm than to implement the algorithm.
4. It is impossible to predict the exact behavior of an algorithm.
